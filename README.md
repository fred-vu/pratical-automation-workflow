# Practical Automation Workflows

This repository showcases the automation workflows I build with n8n and complementary tools. Each workflow is documented to give you a clear, professional overview and inspire you to adapt or extend it for your own use cases.

## Explore the Repository
- Browse each subdirectory to find a complete workflow.
- Every workflow includes high-level documentation, configuration guidance, and any required environment variables.
- Open the local `README.md`, `*.json`, or supporting files to review the implementation details or import flows straight into n8n.

## Current Workflow Library
- `ai-po-extraction-pipeline/` â€“ An AI-powered pipeline that extracts key data from purchase orders, orchestrates document handling, and delivers structured results to your management system.

## Roadmap
- Add new workflows covering operations automation, data processing, and API integrations.
- Enrich existing workflows with diagrams, deployment tips, and best practices.
